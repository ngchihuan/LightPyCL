LightPyCL
=========

LightPyCL is a high performance physical 3D raytracer written in Python/PyOpenCL for the evaluation of optical elements with arbitrary 3D geometry.

## Prerequisites

To get LightPyCl to work, you will need the following things.

1. [PyOpenCL](http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl/) for the heavy lifting.
Installing instructions for PyOpenCL can be found [here](http://wiki.tiker.net/PyOpenCL/Installation/Linux).

2. [dxfwrite](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dxfwrite/) for 3D geometry output.

3. Some DXF viewer (like [g3dviewer](http://automagically.de/g3dviewer/))

4. python-numpy and python-matplotlib
